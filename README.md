# Custom-Artbook-Next-Image-Replacements

In order to install these, go to the place your distribution puts the emulationstation themes
>for emulationstation-de, (so including the Steam Deck) it would be in `~/.emulationstation/themes` directory
>for arkos, its in `/roms/themes`

- Find artbook next, go inside _inc/systems/
- It seems some versions have an artworks folder inside the systems folder, while some put both the artwork and the logos in the folder itself
In any case, find the place wherever your system images are, replace them with the ones i made

Not all systems are on here of course, im doing this for fun and it would be a lot of work to do all of them.
Feel free to leave a feature request for ones you'd like to see, however. 

If lots of people ask one, i will make an effort to add that system as well.

Please also let me know if anybody would be interested in the project files.
I made this in krita so i have .kra files, but i can export them as .psd's as well.
